<h3>
Fun Facts
</h3>

<p>
I have been playing the cello for 15 years now, but I have never really taken a particular interest in it until college. 
This is because I have felt like I am able to play what I'd like rather than what I am told to play. 
That level of freedom has made me appreciate the instrument for what it is rather than as a chore.<br>
I am a Third Degree blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do as of 2020, but I have not continued my studies of Tae Kwon Do due to college. 
Actually, I did try out the Tae Kwon Do club at UMBC, but decided it wasn't the right fit for me.<br>
