I am a Junior at UMBC studying Computer Science with a minor in Music Performace, Cello. <br>
Originally I wanted to be a chemistry major, but I quickly found out I wasn't very good at it through AP Chemistry in High School.<br>
Instead, I decided I enjoyed computer science enough and was good at it to continue my studies down that route.<br>
Although my music minor doesn't really fit in with my major, I didn't want to completely drop my practices with the cello.<br>

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-white">
I have been playing the cello for 15 years now, but I have never really taken a particular interest in it until college. 
This is because I have felt like I am able to play what I'd like rather than what I am told to play. 
That level of freedom has made me appreciate the instrument for what it is rather than as a chore.<br>
I am a Third Degree blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do as of 2020, but I have not continued my studies of Tae Kwon Do due to college. 
Actually, I did try out the Tae Kwon Do club at UMBC, but decided it wasn't the right fit for me.<br>
I am a member of the UMBC Ultimate Frisbee team, Booya Ultimate, and have been since Spring 2022.<br>
I am color blind.<br>
